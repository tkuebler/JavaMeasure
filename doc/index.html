<h1>Java Measure</h1>


A simple to use Java libarary for working with Measures.   This goes beyond simle conversion and encompasses the basic ideas behind measurement systems like Quantities (Base and Dervived), Standards of Measure (english, metric, etc), Units of Measure, etc in an OO way.  Features:

- OO representation of the world of measurement.
     - Quantity
          - Base
               - Length
               - Mass
               - Time
               ...
          - Derived (takes appropriate base quantities as arguements of course)
               - Speed
               ...

     - Standard ( pluggable )
          - English
          - Metric
          - Old English
          - Etc

      - Measurement

      - Utility classes for simple conversion, etc.


All the libraries I could find out there only dealt with simle conversion, and I needed something a little more abstract.
